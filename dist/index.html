			<h1>Welcome.</h1>
			<h2>About us.</h2>
			<p>Here at CalcVox, we want to even the playing field for blind students in mathematical subjects. To do this, we're building a brand new talking calculator, unlike anything the blind community has ever seen before.</p>
			<h3>Key features.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Uses text-to-speech, making sure there's no string or number that the user can't read, and also making the output way less choppy.</li>
				<li>Built with extensebility in mind, allowing you to replace any of the components at will.</li>
				<li>distinct feeling buttons, allowing the user to just do math, not have to memorize the buttons.</li></li>
				<li>Supports high-level math concepts (up to and including graphing) entirely through audio.</li>
				<li>And much, much more.</li>
			</ul>
