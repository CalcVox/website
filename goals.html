			<h1>Week 5</h1>
			<h2>Hardware goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Test speakers by end of Monday</li>
				<li>Finish digitizing sketch of calculator by end of Monday</li>
				<li>Continue PCB Design and get button layout by end of Wednesday</li>
				<li>Polish PCB Design by end of Friday.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Software Goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Round the tinyexpr result to two decimal places using C++ streams by the end of Monday. Completed</li>
				<li>Implement support for multiple pin layouts using #define statements by the end of Monday. Completed</li>
				<li>Implement clearing the entire equation with a button press by the end of Wednesday.</li>
				<li>Implement deletion by character by the end of Friday.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h1>Week 4</h1>
			<h2>Hardware goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Begin planning button layout in google sheets and confirm with Ty by end of Tuesday. Completed</li>
				<li>Research closed loop audio jacks and microcontroller configuration by end of Thursday. Completed</li>
				<li>Begin KiCAD tutorial and start PCB design by end of Thursday. Completed</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Software goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fix loads of driver problems and upgrade development environment. Completed</li>
				<li>Convert the character speaking function to use a map of strings to chars. Completed</li>
				<li>Implement basic expression evaluation using Tinyexpr. Completed</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h1>Week 3</h1>
			<h2>Hardware Goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Test dedicated audio hardware and ensure stereo output by end of Monday. Completed on Wednesday. </li>
				<ul>
					<li>Struggled with getting a clean sine wave out of the I2S DAC through the ESP32</li>
					<li>Determined that the issue was a bad ground and made a designated prototype to fix that issue</li>
					<li>Set the logging level from "INFO" to "WARNING" which helped releave the issue</li>
					<li><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/F56wUFiFHcc?si=vUg13tfm0KqgjW8e">More detail is in this video</a></li>
				</ul>
				<li>Begin planning button layout in google sheets and confirm with Ty by end of Wednesday. Deferred to next week</li>
				<li>Begin KiCAD tutorial and start PCB design by end of Friday. Deferred to next week</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Software goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Map all the buttons to actual functions. Completed</li>
				<li>Store the current equation and history. Completed</li>
				<li>Implement a function that converts mathematical symbols into English equivalents. Completed</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h1>Week 2</h1>
			<h2>Hardware Goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensure prototype can use matrix input and audio output by end of Tuesday. Completed</li>
				<li>Begin researching external audio hardware to be used with Espeak. Completed</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Software goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fix any build errors with submodules and make the build scripts platform-agnostic by the end of Tuesday. Completed</li>
				<li>Begin writing speech handler class by the end of Thursday. Diverted</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This class just caused include path problems, and Espeak's API is actually nice. I wrapped Espeak init into a function, and now it works quite nicely.</li>
					<li>I'll have to wrap it eventually for asynchronous speech and interrupts, but an entire class was overkill.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h1>Week 1</h1>
			<h2>Hardware Goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Test to ensure ePulse Feather ESP32 modules work by end of Monday. Completed</li>
				<li>Research audio out on ESP32 using Arduino Audio Tools by Wednesday. Completed</li>
				<li>Get functioning audio working by end of Friday. Completed</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Software Goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Install and configure the PlatformIO CLI, as well as CMake and a few other C++ build tools. Completed.</li>
				<li>Initialize the project. Completed</li>
				<li>Bootstrap the GitHub repository. Completed</li>
			</ul>
